# Intern_Stuff
I will post some of my code demos summarized during my internship, and also some super fancy stuff from my memo.
You guys will learn some working examples of various operations particularly on Json, web crawling, graph database, 
and some actively used techniques in JAVA development, including Springboot, Mybatis, and Redis.
